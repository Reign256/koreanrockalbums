    <h1>Lee Dong Ki Band - 말못할 사연</h1>
    <p><font size="-1">Apart from Shin Joong Hyun, there is not a lot of solo work by the members of The Add4. One member with some trace of a solo career is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, Seo Jeong Gil.
      <br><br>Although Seo Jeong Gil appeared in many different various artists releases, only contributing about one or two songs, the album below is his most notable release.<br>Not only does it have a significantly large contribution from Seo Jeong Gil compared to his other releases, but it is also the only known solo release with the vocalist on the front cover.
      <br><br>The album also features, among other artists, some tracks sung by Jang Mi Hwa, who appeared as a guest female vocalist on the first Add4 album, <a href="womanintherain.html">Woman In The Rain (비속의 여인).</a>
      <br><br>Some of this album's tracks appeared on the second side of the 6th pressing of Woman In The Rain (비속의 여인). That pressing also features the photo of this album's front sleeve on the back cover.
      <br><br>Although the album doesn't have a set release date, it is theorised to have been released some time in the mid-1960s, due to the catalogue number being close to that of Woman In The Rain (비속의 여인).
      <br><br>Below is the only known pressing of Lee Dong Ki Band's Unspeakable Story (말못할 사연).</font></p>
